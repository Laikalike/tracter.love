# tracter.love

Tracter/Retrace is a puzzle-platformer game inspired by 'The Company of Myself', 'Braid' and the character Tracer from Overwatch.
You complete puzzles with the power of time travel, while co-existing with past versions of yourself.

This project is written in the love2d framework, and will need it to run. (https://love2d.org/)

Download the framework, and drop the tracter.love folder onto the executable file to run the game.
